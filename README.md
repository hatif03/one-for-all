## What Problem It Solves

Business teams know what they want to automate—onboarding, approvals, notifications—but building workflows usually means waiting on developers. **One for All** bridges that gap: describe your process in plain English, and the AI turns it into a working workflow you can run, edit in natural language, and export to tools like n8n.

You can still build from scratch with a full node-based canvas, chain AI steps for content and analysis, and reuse everything. One app for both conversational workflow generation and hands-on automation design.

## Features

### Create with AI

- **Natural language to workflow** — Describe your process (e.g. “When a new employee is hired, send a welcome email, add them to Slack, and schedule training”). The AI clarifies if needed, breaks it into steps, and generates a workflow on the canvas.
- **Intent-based API discovery** — Steps are mapped to actions (email, Slack, HTTP, approvals, delays) from a catalog so the right “nodes” are chosen from your description.
- **Human in the loop** — Review the generated workflow, **edit in natural language** (“Add a delay before the reminder”), and **Approve & deploy** when you’re ready. No automatic deployment without your OK.
- **Self-debugging** — If a node fails when you run the workflow, use **Debug with AI** to send the error and workflow to the model; it suggests a fix and you can re-run.
- **Learning from examples** — Save successful workflows as templates so future generations follow similar patterns (few-shot in the AI).

### Build from Scratch

- **Infinite canvas** — Node-based workflow editor with pan, zoom, and selection.
- **Rich node set** — Triggers (manual, webhook, schedule), actions (HTTP, email, Slack, document), control flow (delay, condition, approval), data transform, plus Prompt, AI, Markdown, and Annotation nodes.
- **Chain AI and actions** — Connect prompts and AI nodes for content, then plug in email, Slack, or HTTP nodes for real-world actions.
- **Bring your own keys** — Use your API keys for LLMs (Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI) and **Connections** for Gmail/SendGrid and Slack. Everything runs in the browser; keys stay local.

### Export & Integrate

- **Export for n8n** — Export the current workflow as n8n-compatible JSON and paste it into n8n.
- **Export to clipboard** — Copy the workflow as JSON for backup or custom tooling.

### Experience

- Free and open-source (MIT).
- Runs entirely in your browser; your data stays private.
- Dark mode, responsive layout, local persistence.
- Add nodes via the **Add node** dropdown (top-left), grouped by Triggers, Actions, Control flow, and Data & AI.

## Use Cases

**HR & onboarding**  
“When a new employee is hired, send a welcome email, add them to Slack, and schedule training.” Describe it once; get a runnable workflow with email, Slack, and delay/approval steps.

**Expense & approvals**  
Multi-step approval flows with human approval nodes, conditions, and notifications.

**Document processing**  
Combine AI nodes for extraction or summarization with document and data nodes.

**Content & productivity**  
Reusable AI chains: proofread, summarize, translate, or generate social posts from a single prompt. Chain Prompt → AI → Markdown and add HTTP/email/Slack where needed.

**Compliance & checks**  
Scheduled or trigger-based workflows with conditions and approval gates.

## Quick Start

Runs in the browser—no backend required. Clone, install, and open the app.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hatif03/one-for-all.git
cd one-for-all
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Then either:

1. **Create with AI** — In the sidebar, click **Create with AI**. Describe your workflow in plain English, answer a couple of questions if asked, then click **Generate workflow**. Review, run, use **Edit in NL** or **Debug with AI** as needed, and **Approve & deploy** when ready.
2. **Build from scratch** — Click **New Workflow**, then use **Add node** (top-left) to add triggers, actions, control nodes, or AI/Markdown/Prompt/Annotation. Connect them and run from the trigger or any node.

**Connections** (sidebar) — Add API keys for Gmail/SendGrid and Slack so email and Slack nodes can run. **API Keys** (sidebar) — Add keys for the AI models you use.

## Node Types

| Category      | Nodes | Purpose |
|---------------|-------|--------|
| **Triggers**  | Manual, Webhook, Schedule | Start a run manually, via HTTP, or on a schedule. |
| **Actions**   | HTTP, Email, Slack, Document | Call APIs, send email/Slack, process documents. |
| **Control**   | Delay, Condition, Approval | Wait, branch on conditions, pause for human approval. |
| **Data & AI** | Transform, Prompt, AI, Markdown, Annotation | Map data; provide input; run LLM; display output; document. |

Each runnable node has a **Run** button; output flows to connected nodes. Approval nodes show **Approve** / **Reject** when the run is waiting.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js** (App Router), **React**, **TypeScript**
- **React Flow** — canvas and nodes
- **Vercel AI SDK** — LLM calls (generateText, streamText) with multiple providers
- **Zustand** — workflow state, API keys, connections, requirement chat
- **Tailwind CSS**, **shadcn/ui** — layout and components
